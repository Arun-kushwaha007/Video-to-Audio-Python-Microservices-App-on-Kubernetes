# 🎧 Video-to-Audio Python Microservices App on Kubernetes

This project is a containerized microservices-based application that extracts audio from video files using Python, with orchestration handled by Kubernetes. It demonstrates the power of distributed systems, RESTful APIs, Docker, and Kubernetes for scalable and efficient media processing.
