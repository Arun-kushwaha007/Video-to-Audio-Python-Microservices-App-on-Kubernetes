# Docker: From Zero to Hero

## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It helps in automating the deployment of applications by packaging them along with their dependencies in containers.

### Why Docker?
- **Portability**: Containers can run on any machine that supports Docker.
- **Consistency**: It ensures the application runs the same, regardless of the environment.
- **Isolation**: Each container runs independently, preventing conflicts.
- **Scalability**: Easily scalable by running more instances of containers.

## Installation

### On Ubuntu/Debian
1. Update your package list and install required packages:
   ```   
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:


curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
Add Docker's repository:


sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
Install Docker:


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
Verify the installation:


sudo docker --version

# On macOS:
Download Docker Desktop from Docker's official website and follow the instructions.

# On Windows:
Download Docker Desktop for Windows from Docker's official website and follow the instructions.

# Basic Docker Commands
Running a Container
To run a container:


docker run hello-world
List Running Containers

docker ps
List All Containers
   
   
   
docker ps -a
Stop a Running Container
   
   
   
docker stop <container_id>
Remove a Stopped Container
   
   
   
docker rm <container_id>
Working with Docker Images
Pull an Image from Docker Hub
   
   
   
docker pull <image_name>
Build an Image from a Dockerfile
To build an image from a Dockerfile, create a Dockerfile with the following content:

dockerfile
   
   
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

#     the current directory contents into the container
    . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
To build the image:

   
   
   
docker build -t my-python-app .
Docker Compose
Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications using a docker-compose.yml file.

# Example 
docker-compose.yml
yaml
   
   
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: "nginx"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  db:
    image: "postgres"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
Running Docker Compose
   
   
   
docker-compose up
Networking in Docker
Containers can communicate with each other via Docker networks.

## Create a Custom Network
   
   
   
docker network create my-network
Run Containers on Custom Network
   
   
   
docker run --network my-network <image_name>
Docker Volumes
Volumes allow you to persist data generated by Docker containers.

## Creating a Volume
   
   
   
docker volume create my-volume
Mounting a Volume
   
   
   
docker run -v my-volume:/data <image_name>

## Advanced Docker Concepts


# Docker Swarm
Docker Swarm is Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool, allowing you to manage a group of Docker hosts as a single virtual system.

# Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a popular container orchestration platform used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Conclusion
Docker is a powerful tool for developing and deploying applications inside containers. It simplifies the process of packaging, shipping, and running applications across environments. Docker also integrates well with orchestration tools like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes for scaling and managing containers effectively.
