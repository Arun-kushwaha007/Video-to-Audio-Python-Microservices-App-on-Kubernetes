## What is RabbitMQ?
RabbitMQ is a **message broker** that allows applications to communicate by sending and receiving messages. It
decouples processes and allows **asynchronous processing**.
---
## Why Use RabbitMQ?
- Decouple Microservices
- Handle Background Tasks
- Improve Scalability
- Retry and Error Handling
- Load Balancing
---
## Core Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Producer** | Sends messages |
| **Queue** | Holds messages |
| **Consumer** | Receives messages |
| **Exchange** | Routes messages to queues |
| **Routing Key** | Tag to route messages |
| **Binding** | Links exchange and queue |

## Installation
Official Docs: https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html
### Using Docker:
```bash
docker run -d --hostname rabbitmq --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
```
- Web UI: http://localhost:15672 (user: guest, pass: guest)
- AMQP Port: 5672
### Manual Install:
- Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server`
- Mac (Homebrew): `brew install rabbitmq`
---
## Basic Producer-Consumer Example (Python)
Install library:
```bash
pip install pika
```
### Producer:
```python
import pika
connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()
channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')
channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='hello', body='Hello World!')
print(" [x] Sent 'Hello World!'")
connection.close()
```
### Consumer:
```python
import pika
def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
 print(f" [x] Received {body}")
connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()
RabbitMQ Learning Guide
channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')
channel.basic_consume(queue='hello', on_message_callback=callback, auto_ack=True)
print(' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C')
channel.start_consuming()
```
---
## Exchanges and Routing
### Types of Exchanges:
- **Direct** Routes by exact match.
- **Fanout** Broadcast to all queues.
- **Topic** Pattern-based routing (wildcards).
- **Headers** Routing based on headers.
---
## Advanced Features
- Message Acknowledgment (`ack`)
- Durable Queues and Persistent Messages
- Dead Letter Exchanges (DLX)
- Priority Queues
- Delayed Messages
- RPC with RabbitMQ
- Clustered and High-Availability Setup
---
## Security and Authentication
- Use vhosts for multi-tenant apps.
- Create custom users:
```bash
rabbitmqctl add_user myuser mypassword
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / myuser ".*" ".*" ".*"
```
- Enable TLS and authentication plugins for production.
---
## Monitoring and Management
- Enable the management plugin:
```bash
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
```
- Access via http://localhost:15672
RabbitMQ Learning Guide
- Monitor:
 - Queues
 - Consumers
 - Message rates
 - Memory/CPU
---
## Use Cases and Patterns
- Task Queues / Job Queues
- Event-Driven Microservices
- Pub/Sub Architecture
- IoT Systems
- Real-Time Analytics Pipelines
---
## Resources
### Official Documentation:
- https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html
### Video Tutorials:
- RabbitMQ Crash Course YouTube (Traversy Media)
### Books:
- RabbitMQ in Action by Alvaro Videla
### Practice Projects:
- Task queue with Flask and Celery
- Microservice architecture with Node.js and RabbitMQ
- Real-time notification system
---
## Final Tips
- Start with simple producer-consumer flows.
- Use Docker to experiment locally.
- Explore `pika`, `amqplib`, or `RabbitMQ.Client` for language-specific implementations.
- Dont skip persistence, retries, and dead-letter queues in production.
Happy Messaging!
